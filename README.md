# Dining_Philosophers_Problem
A solution to the Dining Philosophers Problem using C++ and threads

The project is intended to solve the Dining Philosophers problem. Its a multithreaded application using sempahore flags and mutex locks.
The cout is handled threadsafe. A random number generator class can generate what ever type of number using template methods.

The project was created using Visual Studio 2015.

The project is based on Arbitrator solution with a waiter (monitor) system. This works but also reduces the effectivness of parallelism.
